# vibe-cli ![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vibe-cli)

A CLI tool/wrapper around [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) that supercharges and simplifies your decentralised application workflow.

Vibe-CLI allows you to easily fork, compile, deploy, and call contracts on various networks. It also allows you to easily test your contracts, and interact with your contracts using scripts.

Check out the [example project](https://github.com/GreenWojak/vibe-cli-example).

## Usage

### Initialising / adding Vibe-CLI to a project

```bash
vibe init
```

This command should be ran in the root directory of your project. It will create a `vibe` directory, a `vibe.config.js` file, a `.vibe` file and a `foundry.toml` file.

Vibe-CLI requires Foundry to be installed on your system. If Foundry is not installed, Vibe-CLI will ask if you would like to install it when running any command.

> [!WARNING]
> If youâ€™re on Windows, you will need to install and use Git BASH or WSL as your terminal, since Foundryup currently does not support Powershell or Cmd.

> [!NOTE]
> Vibe-CLI and Foundry require you to use the `.t.sol` extension for your test files, and `.s.sol` for your script files in order for it to work correctly.

### Forking a network

```bash
vibe fork <network> [-d]
```

(See list of supported networks [here](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/chains).)

For example, to fork the Binance Smart Chain mainnet: `vibe fork bsc`. 

This command can be ran from any directory. It will fork the network specified in the command using [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/).

If the `--deploy (-d)` flag is set, the contracts specified in `vibe.config.js` under that chain will be deployed to the network after forking.

Vibe-CLI will pass any other flags directly to Anvil.

### Compiling contracts

```bash
vibe compile
```

This command will compile the contracts specified in the `vibe.config.js` file in your project.

### Deploying contracts

```bash
vibe deploy <network>
```

This command will deploy the contracts specified in the `vibe.config.js` file in your project to the network specified in the command.

Contracts are deployed in order. If one contract depends on an already deployed contract, you can use it as a constructor argument by using the `$` symbol followed by the contract name (e.g. `"$Counter"`).

### Running scripts

```bash
vibe run <network> <command> [args]
```

This command will run the Solidity script defined in the `vibe.config.js` file in your project with the command and arguments specified.

### Supplying test tokens

```bash
vibe supply <network> <address>
```

This command will supply the supply balance in ETH and tokens defined in the `vibe.config.js` file in your project to the specified addresses on a forked network.

### Testing contracts

```bash
vibe check <network>
```

It will run the tests located in the `vibe/tests` directory of your project (unless specified otherwise in the config) on the network specified in the command using `forge test`.

### Running RPC methods

```bash
vibe curl <method> [args]
```

This command will run the RPC method specified in the command with the provided arguments on the currently forked network (e.g. `vibe curl evm_setIntervalMining 2`).

### Refreshing deployment files

```bash
vibe refresh
```

This command will Update all deployment files with the addresses found in the .vibe file.

### Deployed Contract .json Structure

```json
{
  "abi": [],
  "deployments": {
    "[chain ID]": "contract address (0x...)"
  }
}
```

### .vibe

This file contains the addresses of the deployed contracts. It is automatically generated when deploying contracts.
